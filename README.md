ZapposMobileAppChallenge
========================

Zappos Mobile Application

This was a coding challenge that I completed for Zappos. 
The purpose of this application was to provide an email and a product name or product ID for this application to watch. 
I used google app engine as my backend to faciliate scheduled query calls to the zappos server.


The ZapposMobileAppChallenge was developed for iPhone.
